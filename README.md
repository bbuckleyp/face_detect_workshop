Home Automation with the DragonBoard 410c

The is to familiarize myself with the Python scripting language, the
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library, the Linux operating system, and the
DragonBoardâ„¢ 410c. I will create a small Python program which utilizes a USB
webcam for a variety of applications. These include: taking a picture, saving a picture, displaying
a live video feed from the webcam, and performing facial recognition.
